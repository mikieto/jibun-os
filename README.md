# Jibun OS - An "AI Navigator" for Self-Evolution

**Jibun OS is a personal operating system, designed as an "AI Navigator," that enables knowledge workers to leverage their weaknesses as strengths and continue creating value in the age of AI.**

## 🚀 The Why Behind This Project

In an era of intense meritocracy and the threat of AI substitution, many knowledge workers face anxiety and a "paralysis of action" born from perfectionism.

This project's mission is to provide a robust framework that transforms these challenges—traits often labeled as "weaknesses"—into valuable resources for creativity and problem-solving. We are building an **"AI Navigator"** to help you thrive in this new era.

## 🚀 Quick PoC: Initialize Your OS via AI Dialogue

### The Why Behind This Project

Our vision is to provide a "Reproducible Self" template to the world, empowering everyone with their own OS for self-evolution.

As the first step toward this vision, our immediate mission is to build an OS that accelerates our own learning loop, with a measurable goal of **reducing our decision-making cycle time by 30%**.

This PoC offers a glimpse into the core concept: operating your OS through a simple dialogue with an AI.

### Your 5-Minute Quick Start

1.  **Setup**
    Use this repository as a GitHub template to create your own. Then, open it in **GitHub Codespaces**.
    > Required dependencies are automatically installed via the `devcontainer` setup, ensuring a zero-config start.

2.  **Execution**
    Open the chat interface in VSCode/Cursor and say the following to the AI (me):
    > **"Initialize this OS for me."**

3.  **Result**
    The AI will ask for your name and other details, then automatically generate your personal configuration files (e.g., `legislation/personal/profile.yaml`). You will receive a confirmation message:
    > **"Initialization complete. I've created your profile at `legislation/personal/profile.yaml`."**

And that's it. The basic setup for your personal OS is now complete.

## 🏛️ Four-Layer Architecture

This OS is built on a four-layer governance model, separating timeless principles from daily records.
